### Enhancements
- Better structure for outputting results. Thanks to @dzol/@findmypast [#83]
- Use external Gherkin library. Shared with the https://github.com/cabbage-ex project.

### Bug fixes
none

### Backwards incompatible changes
- The way custom output is configured has changed. Previously a config key `outputer` was expected to give a 
module implementing the output protocol. This has now been replaced with an event driven model and the key `outputers`
is now expected see #83 for details. This detail was not previously part of the official public interface.

## 3.0.0 (2016-12-18)

### Enhancements
- Roles are now parsed. So any feature with ```As a Person``` in the description can be filtered using it. See #54 for details.
- In async mode scenerios can now timeout. The scenario_timeouts macro is can be used to specifiy a function which generates custom timeouts. See #57.
- The finalize functions are now given the success (or failure) status. Thanks to @mgwidmann.[#75]
- `suite` can now be specified on the command line to filter to run a single suite from the config. [#77]
- HTML Output for White Bread now available thanks to @Dzol (and @mentels for reviewing) [#81]

### Bug fixes
- Run the scenario starting state for outlines just as for simple scenarios. Thanks to @marnen. [#73]
- Long running scenerio steps now longer cause undefined failures in aysnc mode see [#52].

### Backwards incompatible changes
- Elixir 1.0 no longer supported due to changes in #57. Elixir 1.1 and above is needed.
- The context behaviour is extended to require ```callback get_scenario_timeout(Feature.t, Scenario.t) :: number``` any contexts not ```use```ing ```WhiteBread.Context``` will need to add the function.
- The *_starting_state and *_finalize functions in the context behaviour have been standardised so a pair each for feature and scenario.
- `tags` and `context` are no longer supported on the command line. Tags will be reintroduced in a later release. Context will not as everything will now require a suite configuration. [#77]
- `subcontext` macro renamed to `import_steps_from` to make intent clearer.

## V2.8.1 (2016-09-29)

### Enhancements

- Allows extra config to be added to each suite generated by ```context_per_feature``` by adding a list of key-values to ```extra```.

### Bug fixes
none

### Backwards incompatible changes
none

### Notes
- The runner protocol has been removed as this added complexity but little obvious benefit.
