# Changelog

## V-NEXT (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Enhancements
- Roles are now parsed. So any feature with ```As a Person``` in the description can be filtered using it. See #54 for details.
- In async mode scenerios can now timeout. The scenario_timeouts macro is can be used to specifiy a function which generates custom timeouts. See #57.

### Bug fixes
- Run the scenario starting state for outlines just as for simple scenarios. [#73]
- Long running scenerio steps now longer cause undefined failures in aysnc mode see #52.

### Backwards incompatible changes
- Elixir 1.0 no longer supported due to changes in #57. Elixir 1.1 and above is needed.
- The context behaviour is extended to require ```callback get_scenario_timeout(Feature.t, Scenario.t) :: number``` any contexts not ```use```ing ```WhiteBread.Context``` will need to add the function.
- The *_starting_state and *_finalize functions in the context behaviour have been standardised so a pair each for feature and scenario.

## V2.7.0 (2016-04-23)

- Allows extra config to be added to each suite generated by ```context_per_feature``` by adding a list of key-values to ```extra```.

### Bug fixes
none

### Backwards incompatible changes
none

### Notes
- The runner protocol has been removed as this added complexity but little obvious benefit.
