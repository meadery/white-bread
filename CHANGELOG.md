# Changelog

## V2.7.0 (2016-04-23)

### Enhancements
- Adds the ability to run all features and scenarios within a suite asynchronously by adding ```run_async: true```.
- Allows extra config to be added to each suite generated by ```context_per_feature``` by adding a list of key-values to ```extra```.

### Bug fixes
none

### Backwards incompatible changes
none

### Notes
- The runner protocol has been removed as this added complexity but little obvious benefit.
